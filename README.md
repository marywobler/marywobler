New to Colorado, I recently moved here from Chicago, IL which was my home for the last 5 years. In this time I graduated Cum Laude from DePaul University with a BA in Public Relations and Advertising, and a minor in Graphic Design. I have been working as an Assistant Media Strategist for global CPG brands and a global non-profit organization for the last year and a half now. As an analytical, critical thinker I have experience with problem solving, strategic planning, and data analysis. I am currently looking for a strategic, data-driven position in a analytics or marketing. My passions lie in data-driven consumer insights and marketing research. I thrive on constantly being challenged to improve my professional and personal skills, and am always eager to learn something new!
