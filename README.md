New to Colorado, I recently moved here from Chicago, IL which was my home for the last 5 years. In this time I graduated Cum Laude from DePaul University with a BA in Public Relations and Advertising, and a minor in Graphic Design. I have been working as an Assistant Media Strategist for global CPG brands and a global non-profit organization for the last year and a half now. As a critical thinker with experience in problem solving, strategic planning, and data analysis I am looking for a strategic, data-driven position in a analytics or marketing. I would like to further my strategic marketing analytic and technical skills to pursue my passion for data-driven marketing research and consumer insights. I thrive on constantly being challenged to improve my professional and personal skills, and am always eager to learn something new!
