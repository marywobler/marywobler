My name is Mary Wobler, and I am currently in my Junior year of college at DePaul University pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Public Relations and Advertising, with a minor in graphic design. I moved to Chicago, Illinois about three years ago from San Diego, California, and could not be happier with the experiences I have gained so far from living in the city and the courses I have taken at DePaul. I am very passionate about the work I do, as well as the communications industry itself. I love constantly learning more about all the industry has to offer, in order to improve my professional and personal skills.
